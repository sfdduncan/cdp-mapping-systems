My dataset is a collection of all the Filipino restaurants in NYC which I pulled from the NYC ABCEats-Restaurants listings. Part of this is mostly because I was interested in seeing all the Filipino restuarants in NYC, but also to potentially contribute to a greater network analysis project I am doing. 
Additionally, I am to also use street centerline data and subsequently filter for pedestrian friendly streets: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Centerline/inkn-q76z/about_data
Ideally, I would use data that was more aggregated to sidewalks as I am also doing a network analysis project in Luc & Meli's class that incorporates Universal Thermal Climate Index to assess which routes are both the shortest and most comfortable (regarding heat/urban heat islands) to walk in.
